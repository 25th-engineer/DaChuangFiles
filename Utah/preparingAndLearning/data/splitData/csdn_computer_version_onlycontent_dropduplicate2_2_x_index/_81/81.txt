《从CVPR 2014看计算机视觉领域的最新热点》提供了一个了解CVPR的窗口，阅读后结合自身工作有些随想记录在此。
1、尚未被深度学习渗透的Low-level Vision ；
2、Depth Sensor（深度传感器）及深度图像；
这两点都可以作为对非深度学习值得深入的方向 。
其中包括3A算法在内的去模糊、稳像、图像抠图、去涂鸦适合以技术技能在图像处理方面的EG，这个方向一直在发展，受到机器学习算法的影响较小，对于美图类应用、手机及芯片制造商来说，还是热门技术
计算机视觉一直在发展，热像仪、车载夜视仪、安防的指纹人脸门禁考勤机，视频行为分析摄像机、ADAS防碰撞电子后视镜等，到微软的kinect、灵格深瞳的RGB-D相机，再到360全景相机，作为前段的采集分析设备一直在革新，嵌入式软件工程师在创业型公司（如DGI）是越来越火，源于智能硬件的兴起 。
