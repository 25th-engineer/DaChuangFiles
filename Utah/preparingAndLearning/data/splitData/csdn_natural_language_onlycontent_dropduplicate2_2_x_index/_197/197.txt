How this list got started
On November 10, 2016, a Hacker News (HN) user aarohamankad asked the HN community for suggestions on beginner NLP resources. This Ask HN thread became popular and stayed in the front page for some time. In this time, it gathered plenty of community generated suggestions about beginner NLP resources. This list is an attempt to summarize this discussion into a coherent list of resources. I also wrote a blog post on this.
